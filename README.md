# Simple Static Bio Site

This is a simplified version of the bio page that can be directly uploaded to Netlify or any static hosting provider without requiring any build process.

## Files
- `index.html` - Contains all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file
- `background-music.mp3` - Background music file
- `netlify.toml` - Simple configuration for Netlify deployment

## Deploying to Netlify

1. Log in to your Netlify account
2. Go to "Sites" and click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop this entire folder onto the upload area
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. Your site will be live at a Netlify subdomain

## Important Notes

- This version has all the styling and JavaScript embedded directly in the HTML file for simplicity
- The chart data is simulated in JavaScript since this is a static site
- No build process is required
- Make sure to upload the entire folder, not just individual files
